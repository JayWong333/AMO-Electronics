# AMO-Electronics
Collection of electronics projects intended for conducting atomic physics experiments.


## ECDL_CUR_CTRL
This folder contains the schematics and board layout for an ultra-low noise laser diode current controller. It builds upon proven designs of Libbrecht & Hall (https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1143949) as well as Erickson et. al. (https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2953597).

## Analog Temp Controller
This folder contains the schematics and board layout for a thermoelectric cooler controller. It features a PID-loop that drives a Peltier element (or alternatively a resistive heater) in order to match the resistance of a NTC thermistor to a given set temperature.
